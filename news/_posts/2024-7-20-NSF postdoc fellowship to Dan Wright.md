title: NSF Postdoc Fellowship to Dan Wright!
---

Congrats to Dan Wright on his NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship (NSF OPP-2420167)! This will support his work in the lab investigating the genetic mechanisms of renal adaptations and antifreeze-induced kidney plasticity in high latitude cods. In this project, Dan will be applying histology, single cell sequencing, comparative genomics, and zebrafish genetics to identify molecular mechanisms by which the glomerulus can induce and then recover from a seasonal functional disruption
