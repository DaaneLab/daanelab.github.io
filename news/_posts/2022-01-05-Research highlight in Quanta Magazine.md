title: Research highlight in Quanta Magazine

Excellent review on our recent work in flying fishes by [Viviane Callier](https://www.quantamagazine.org/authors/viviane-callier/) published today in [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/flying-fish-and-aquarium-pets-yield-secrets-of-evolution-20220105#)

The story covers our paired comparative genomic and laboratory genetic approaches for addressing questions in evo-devo, simple genetic changes underlying major morphological transitions in evolution and highlights other work by the [Harris lab at HMS](https://genetics.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/matthew-harris)
