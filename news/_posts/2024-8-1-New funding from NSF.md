title: New funding from NSF!
---

New funding from NSF in collaboration with [Mackenzie Gerringer](https://www.geneseo.edu/gerringer-mackenzie) at SUNY Geneseo to investigate the genetic and biochmeical mechanisms of adaptation of fishes to high hydrostatic pressure (#2407552)! We will assemble genomes from deep-sea fishes from the warm waters of Mediterranean trenches, perform comparative genomics across deep-adapted lineages, examine biochemistry of hadal proteins, and initiate hydrostatic pressure experiments in zebrafish embryos to identify pressure-responsive enhancer elements.
