# Lake Texana, 2023

<br/>

We are looking for pipefish in Lake Texana and along the Texas Gulf Coast. This is part of a study on how fish with aglmorular kidneys are able to survive in freshwater. The glomerulus is very important in freshwater fishes to facilitate the removal of excess water. However, many pipefish species have independently colonized freshwater despite not having a glomerulus. These samples will complemenet comparative genomic analyses in the clade and provide gene expression data across osmoregulatory organs from populations in marine and freshwater conditions.
