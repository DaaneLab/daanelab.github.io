We are searching for high latitude cod tissue samples as part of study of seasonal cycles of disruption and rejuvination in the kidney glomerulus. Glomerular function in cods is thought to be associated with whether antifreeze is being produced. In at least one species, production of antifreeze leads to a loss of glomerular function, which then recovers when antifreeze is no longer produced. How widespread this phenomenon is in cods, and the molecular mechanisms enabling this tissue plasticity is unknown.
