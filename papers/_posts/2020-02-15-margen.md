# Abstract
The ancient origins and functional versatility of globins make them ideal subjects for studying physiological adaptation to environmental change. Our goals in this review are to describe the evolution of the vertebrate globin gene superfamily and to explore the structure/function relationships of hemoglobin, myoglobin, neuroglobin and cytoglobin in teleost fishes. We focus on the globins of Antarctic notothenioids, emphasizing their adaptive features as inferred from comparisons with human proteins.
