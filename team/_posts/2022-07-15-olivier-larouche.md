Olivier was a postdoc in the lab. He did his PhD work with Richard Cloutier and Miriam Zelditch at Université du Québec à Rimouski studying morphological disparity and modularity of the median and paired fins in basal vertebrates. He has continued his investigations into morphological evolution in fishes as a postdoc in the labs of [Samantha Price](https://evovert.com/index.html) at Clemson University and [Kory Evans](https://koryevans.weebly.com/) at Rice University. His project in the Daane lab focused on the genetics of the body shape evolution in fishes and on mechansims of compensatory evolution in the hearts of Antarctic icefishes.

He is currently an Assistant Professor at the [University of Western Carolina](https://www.wcu.edu/)
